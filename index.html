          was born in Los Angeles California and have been living in Tulsa since
          I was 7. I graduated high school in 2010 from Broken Arrow High and
          went to Tulsa Tech for automotive service. I started working on cars
          soon after graduating and have worked as a collision technician for
          over a decade. My interest are all over the place and I enjoy trying
          and learning new things as much as I can. I have one dog who has been
          with me for almost 15 years now and he's now blind, deaf, not very
          bright and smell blind. I got one little sister who's a vet tech and
          she has a dog who is over at our house enough to consider her my dogs
          little sister too, though she's bigger than him and she has a limp,
          she's way smarter.
