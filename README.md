This website is made up of four pages.
- Home Page: This is the entry point of the Website. Here you will find a brief welcome message and summary of the site. Followed by an introduction to the project's team members, along with an image provided by each member. The Home page establishes the overall theme of the website. Featuring a yellow striped header and black ellipses Title reminiscent of a standard no.2 pencil. Below there are three columns. On the left we have our Navigation links leading to itself and the other three pages. In the center we have a white striped main content column, intended to resemble a sheet of lined paper. On the right we include an Extra Content column. This is where our pages may choose to include a bonus feature or aside text. On this particular page we have include an implementation of the ICanHazDadJoke Api to display a new joke at a set interval. Below these columns we have our footer. Attached to the footer is an image of a blue paper texture. We've included likes here to the Apis used in our project as well as a link to this Repository and the Atlas School Website. This theme should carry over to the remaining pages. (Collaborators: Torin Teale & Fredy Salazar)
- Word Scramble: This page features a simple word-based letter scramble game. The goal is to utilize the Random Word Api to populate the word scrambler. (Author: Fredy Salazar)
- Learn a Word: This page utilizes the Random Word Api and Word Definition Api to generate a word for the user upon clicking the "New Word!" button. There is a brief introduction and summary of the page's function; including a disclaimer that, despite the visual presentation of the webite, there is not a limitaion of any kind filtering the words and definitions to be child friendly. The user is able to specify whether they'd like to generate a Noun, Verb, Adverb, Adjective, or any of the aforementioned parts of speech. In the Extra Content column the function displays the ten most recent words generated and counts how many times the button has been pressed in a given session. Clicking on any of the recent words will pull up the word and it's definition in the main content area. (Author: Torin Teale)
- Word Association Game: This page should feature a game that utilizes a similar api to generate a user's input's synonyms and antnyms. (Author: Candy Owens)
